            This is <b>Laravel-Voldb</b> a volunteer database built using the Laravel framework.
            This project is based on the online volunteer systems used by festivals like Burning Man, Apogaea, and Elsewhence.
            There are probably lots of other festivals that have similar systems, but I've never used them! :)
